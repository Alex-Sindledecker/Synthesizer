# Synthesizer
I made this as my final project for my senior year of high school. It worked at one point but currently just makes a very interesting chiming noise. One day I might fix it if I have time. Once I do, you will be able to use the A, B, C, D, E, F, and G keys to play their respective notes. The arrow keys can be used to shift each note up or down by a semitone.
